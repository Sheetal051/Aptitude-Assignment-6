Q: A dealer sold a bicycle at a profit of 10%. Had he bought the bicycle at 10% less price and sold it at a price Rs. 60 more, he would have gained 25%. The cost price of the bicycle was?
Ans:
Let's say the cost price of the bicycle is x.

Since the dealer sold the bicycle at a profit of 10%, the selling price is:
Selling price = x + (10% of x) = x + 0.1x = 1.1x

Now, if the dealer had bought the bicycle at 10% less price, the new cost price would be:
New cost price = x - (10% of x) = x - 0.1x = 0.9x

If the dealer sold the bicycle at a price Rs. 60 more, the new selling price would be:
New selling price = 1.1x + 60

Since the dealer would have gained 25% in this scenario, the new selling price is:
New selling price = New cost price + (25% of New cost price) = 0.9x + (0.25 Ã— 0.9x) = 0.9x + 0.225x = 1.125x

Equating the two expressions for the new selling price, we get:
1.1x + 60 = 1.125x

Subtracting 1.1x from both sides gives:
60 = 0.025x

Dividing both sides by 0.025 gives:
x = 2400

So, the cost price of the bicycle is Rs. 2400.
